\title{Signs of Gentrification}
\subtitle{An Analysis into Amsterdam's Storefront Signage with Machine Learning and Street View Imagery}

\begin{abstract}
% % A summary of results should be included. Avoid citations. Maximum length is 200 words.
Gentrification refers to the process of a neighborhood changing as a result of wealthier residents moving in, bringing improvements but displacing existing residents due to rising prices and changing cultures. Studies have pointed out how storefront signage mirrors gentrification: as a rich communication medium with intentional designs, there are clear differences in signage on gentrified and non-gentrified facades. However, these qualitative studies are labor-intensive and are limited in generalizability, as they were conducted on selected neighborhoods, not city-wide. The current research explored the use of computer vision to overcome these limitations in learning signage aesthetics, and simultaneously detect gentrification in signage from unseen parts of the city. Trained on a set of large-scale street view imagery of Amsterdam, the model was able to distinguish gentrified from non-gentrified signage with F1-score of 0.69. The city-wide pattern of gentrification learned by the model was similar to what has been described by past qualitative research. Moreover, the model's output identified cases where signs did not follow the typical patterns - a nuance previous studies did not conclude on. Lastly, the model has the ability to detect the same aesthetics in unseen images of signage from different areas in the city.
