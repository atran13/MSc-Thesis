Neighborhood initial status was defined as above- (high status) or below-average (low status) median income in 2004. Neighborhood grading was defined as an increase (upgrading) or decrease (downgrading) in the median income (corrected for inflation) during the period 2004â€“11. Note how Zuidoost and Nieuw-West were found to be downgrading, and Oud-West and Centrum-West - particularly De Jordaan - were found to be upgrading.}

Displacement was defined as an above-average share of migration among low-income residents and an above-average share of migration among middle- or high-income residents. Social mobility was defined as an above-average share of low-income residents experiencing upward social mobility (and become middle- or high-income) while staying in the same neighbourhood. Ageing was defined as an above-average share of low-income residents ageing out of the core population. Note how Oud-West and Centrum-West - particularly De Jordaan - were found to have undergone social mobility, displacement, and ageing; while no such trend was found for Zuidoost and Nieuw-West.}
