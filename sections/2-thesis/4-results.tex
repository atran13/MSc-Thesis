It was found that the text detection model returned almost all signage instances present in the original street view images, including signage with non-horizontal and curved text. Cases where the model failed include very small, and therefore illegible texts, especially in lower resolution images. Additionally, the model also returned some noise, namely texts on street signs (e.g. traffic signs, street names), and watermarks ("Â©Google", as the images in Street-Swipe were originally from Google Street View) - these instances were manually removed.

\subsubsection{Fine-tuned}
The best performing model with ResNet18 architecture was found with learning rate set to 0.001, batch size 32, and 60 training epochs. The best performing model with ResNet50 architecture was found with learning rate set to 0.01, batch size 64, and 60 training epochs. The macro-averaged metrics for these models on the validation and test sets are shown in Table \ref{fig:resnet_compare}. The fine-tuned ResNet50 had better performance, its classwise metrics are shown in Table \ref{fig:resnet50_cls}.

\subsection{Inspecting model's output}
\label{subsec:result4}

\subsubsection{Correct classifications}

StreetSwipe's correctly classified signage showed the most typical and distinguishing characteristics of signage per class, which can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:output_vis}.

Gentrified signage were more similar in font types (more modern and minimal fonts) and often did not vary in text sizes, while non-gentrified signage used more types of fonts (more classic and decorated fonts), sometimes more than one font on a single sign, and sometimes with varying text sizes and orientations. In addition, gentrified signs mostly had white texts, with minimal variation in background colors. Non-gentrified signs were the opposite: text colors and background colors varied more; plus a notable usage of neon signage. In terms of languages, besides Dutch, gentrified signage had more English text, with very rare appearances of non-Latin languages (e.g. Korean); while non-gentrified ones were largely in Dutch, with appearances of English, Chinese and Arabic. And finally, although out of scope of the study, the model also picked up graffiti as text instances belonging to non-gentrified facades.


\subsubsection{Incorrect classifications} 

StreetSwipe's misclassified signage showed characteristics of cases the model failed to distinguish. The misclassified instances with high certainty showed similar characteristics to correctly classified instances (gentrified: minimal text fonts and colors, less variation in font styles and background colors; non-gentrified: more variation in fonts, text colors and background colors). On the other hand, mis-classified instances with lower certainty showed a more nuanced picture. Signal strength diminished and the model's outputs of the two classes were more or less indistinguishable. There were similar variations in font styles, text colors and background colors, without any characteristic that stood out. Results can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:output_vis_SS_incorrect}.


\subsubsection{Classifications on extended data}

On the extended data, signage classified by the model followed the same patterns per class as learned from StreetSwipe; however, visual inspection of the corresponding facades showed not all classifications were true to human perception. Results can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:output_vis_pano}.
