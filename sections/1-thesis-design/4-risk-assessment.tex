\section{Risk Assessment}
\label{sec:risk_assessment}

A risk that this project could run into is not getting synthetic data and/or the pre-trained model from Ma et al. [2019]. This could be due to the authors being unable or unwilling to share the data. In this case, other datasets for scene-text recognition are publicly available, such as ICDAR 2013 and SVT (Street view text), albeit in smaller sizes, and extra work would need to be done to annotate the data with relevant labels.
