	isbn = {978-3-642-15549-9},
	abstract = {We present a method for spotting words in the wild, i.e., in real images taken in unconstrained environments. Text found in the wild has a surprising range of difficulty. At one end of the spectrum, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) applied to scanned pages of well formatted printed text is one of the most successful applications of computer vision to date. At the other extreme lie visual CAPTCHAs – text that is constructed explicitly to fool computer vision algorithms. Both tasks involve recognizing text, yet one is nearly solved while the other remains extremely challenging. In this work, we argue that the appearance of words in the wild spans this range of difficulties and propose a new word recognition approach based on state-of-the-art methods from generic object recognition, in which we consider object categories to be the words themselves. We compare performance of leading OCR engines – one open source and one proprietary – with our new approach on the ICDAR Robust Reading data set and a new word spotting data set we introduce in this paper: the Street View Text data set. We show improvements of up to 16\% on the data sets, demonstrating the feasibility of a new approach to a seemingly old problem.},

	doi = {10.1109/BigData55660.2022.10020745},
	abstract = {Cities are laden with visual clues—public road signs, advertising billboards, street names, place names, street art, and commercial shop signs. In urban studies literature, it is common to use such clues, littered along streetscapes, to understand cities better. Sociologists have tried to derive meaning from the linguistic diversity in streetscapes, but their efforts are limited by the laborious effort of field s tudies. Taking a dvantage of the availability of street view imagery (SVI) today and the advent of deep learning driven by the availability of big data, we undertake a machine learning approach to quantify the linguistic diversity in cities. In this paper, we introduce a language detection tool to identify the presence of English, Swedish, Arabic and Chinese in streetscapes. The tool is built on a pretrained DenseNet-121 model and trained with both synthetic images, and real streetscapes scraped from Google Street View (GSV). We achieve a test accuracy of 80.8\% across all four languages, surpassing the performance of best performing optical character recognition (OCR) tools by 9 percentage points. The F1 score of 79.8\% also surpasses that of present OCR tools by 11 percentage points, which suggests that our model is both accurate and reliable. We use the gradient-weighted class activation map (Grad-CAM) to show that our model is visually interpretable. We then apply the tool to Stockholm, Sweden to create a portrait of the linguistic diversity of the city and find a chasm between linguistic diversity and population diversity, which points to the importance of measuring the two measures separately.},
